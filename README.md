# SplitGPT Frontend

A project to help resolve balances between friends using natural language processing and a debt simplification algorithm.

Live on Vercel: https://splitgpt-alexwei.vercel.app/
Backend: https://github.com/alexcjwei/splitgpt-backend

This is my first time using SvelteKit so we just have a single-page app. SvelteKit was pretty nice.

## Features

This is just the frontend, so we have:
1. Basic text form with validation,
2. Editable table inputs which updates dynamic content,
3. Debt simplification algorithm which runs on the table data.


## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
